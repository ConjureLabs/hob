Hob (short for Hobgoblin) does chores in the background, helping your app run smoothly. Usually.

Hob is a framework of frameworks, to enforce an opinionated setup on Conjure projects.

### Setup

```sh
npm install --save @conjurelabs/hob
```

or

```sh
yarn add @conjurelabs/hob
```

### Building

`hob build`

### Lints

`hob lint`

This will run lints and coding style checks on your project. It uses defaults set by Hob.

You can override the defaults by adding the following to your project's root dir:

- `.eslintrc`
- `.jscsrc`
